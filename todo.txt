-- Twilio porting project
  -- Update the client to share the server error message when sending
  
-- Add a button to show/hide members, ie: Manage Recipients, Hide Member Management
-- Break out the webhook specific code so that twilio or another service could do the message
-- Make ABR stuff (logo, name) work with environment variables
-- Set up websockets, dynamically update the table data based on backend changes
-- Warn if user tries to activate someone who has opted out.
-- Keep a store of sent messages in the database
-- Add export/import to/from csv of membershp list
-- Add a view of past messages (message, initiator username, recipient numbers)
-- Figure out how to set up Mongo IP Whitelist for Heroku production (maybe impossible with free version?)
-- Allow users to cancel/edit in the dialog after send it
-- Think about fixing race condition if user opts out but client webpage is out of sync with DB.   This will fix itself if I ever do a websocket and dynamically update the send counts

Done:
